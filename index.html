		<p>
<b>We are interested in unraveling the underlying physical principles that govern the dynamics, 
		         statistics, and self-organization of nanostructured materials, 
		         in and out of thermal equilibrium, from both fundamental and technological 
		        aspects</b>. Using a combination of experiment, theory, and computation 
		         such as in-situ liquid phase transmission electron microscopy (LPTEM), 
		         nanoscience and colloidal chemistry, stochastic thermodynamics, and machine learning, we work on 
		         the following projects in our group:
		        	</p>
		        <p>
<li>Dynamics of nanoparticles in interaction with heterogeneous surfaces</li>
<li>Phase behavior and dynamics of biological macromolecules in their native liquid environment at the nanoscale</li>
<li>AI for finding the hidden physical rules in nanoscale systems</li>

Zain was born and raised in Lahore, Pakistan and lived in Switzerland for four years during middle school. 
Zain completed his BEng in Chemical Engineering and MSc in Advanced Process Integration and Design 
from the UK. During his undergraduate studies at Newcastle University, Zain started developing
 an interest in mathematical modeling and computer programming. For this reason, he pursued
  a Master’s degree in Process Integration and Design, and in his free time, learned Python
   programming, Machine Learning and Data Science. Before starting his Ph.D., Zain worked 
   in Fatima Group in Pakistan as a Supply Chain management associate, where he used 
   statistical time-series forecasting methods to forecast the prices of important commodities.
Zain is an avid fan of cricket, and in his free time loves to work out, play table tennis and pool.
