		<p>

		        We are an interdisciplinary group of researchers who are eager to solve fundamental
		         problems with high technological and societal impact. We have a very open, collaborative research team.
		          The theme that connects all our research areas is <b>dynamics at the nanoscale</b>. We both develop new methods (both experimental
		           (e.g., microscopy) and computational (e.g., AI/ML)) and apply existing and newly developed methods to problems that have
		            interesting questions on the nanoscale, ranging from the properties of nanomaterials with energy applications to how
		             biological molecules function. The goal of our research is <b>to uncover the underlying physical principles that govern the dynamics, 
		         statistics, and self-organization of nanostructured materials</b>. 
		        Using a combination of experiment, theory, and computation 
		         such as in-situ liquid phase transmission electron microscopy (LPTEM), fluorescence optical microscopy,
		         nanoscience and colloidal chemistry, stochastic thermodynamics, and machine learning, we work on 
		         the following projects in our group:
		        	</p>
		        <p>
<li>Dynamics of nanoparticles in interaction with heterogeneous environments</li>
<li>Phase behavior and dynamics of biological macromolecules in their native liquid environment at the nanoscale</li>
<li>AI for finding the hidden physical rules in nanoscale systems</li>

Zain was born and raised in Lahore, Pakistan and lived in Switzerland for four years during middle school. 
Zain completed his BEng in Chemical Engineering and MSc in Advanced Process Integration and Design 
from the UK. During his undergraduate studies at Newcastle University, Zain started developing
 an interest in mathematical modeling and computer programming. For this reason, he pursued
  a Master’s degree in Process Integration and Design, and in his free time, learned Python
   programming, Machine Learning and Data Science. Before starting his Ph.D., Zain worked 
   in Fatima Group in Pakistan as a Supply Chain management associate, where he used 
   statistical time-series forecasting methods to forecast the prices of important commodities.
Zain is an avid fan of cricket, and in his free time loves to work out, play table tennis and pool.

	<p><b>CHBE 4803/8803: AI for Experimental Chemical Engineers</b></p>
<p><b>Course Description:</b> This course has two primary objectives: (a) to introduce students 
to advanced deep learning and AI methods and (b) to teach students how to use such models
 on experimental data relevant to chemical engineers. This course links the topics of AI 
 and data science to experimental chemical engineering applications. Chemical engineers 
 work with experimental data of various modalities that span microscopy images, time series
  data, spectrophotometry data, and texts, to name a few. This course will first introduce
   students to the foundations of popular AI models developed in the last 10 years and 
   their application in analyzing experimental data. In addition to covering various model
    architectures (e.g., CNN, VAE, LLM, etc.), we will cover foundational topics related 
    to AI, including framing loss function, initialization, error backpropagation, gradient
     computation, and model fitting. The course will maintain a balance between neural 
     network basics and application to experimental data at hand, such that the students 
     obtain key knowledge on how to efficiently select the most suitable AI model and apply
      it to the data, know the mathematical principles of the model operation, test the 
      model performance, and relevant statistical analysis. Overall, by the end of the course,
       the students will have a good understanding of how to apply AI models to experimental
        data relevant to chemical engineers and extract useful information.</p>
