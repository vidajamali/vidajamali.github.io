		<p>
<b>We are interested in unraveling the underlying physical principles that govern the dynamics, 
		         statistics, and self-organization of nanostructured materials, 
		         in and out of thermal equilibrium, from both fundamental and technological 
		        aspects</b>. To answer this we use a combination of experiment, theory, and computation 
		         such as in-situ liquid phase transmission electron microscopy (LPTEM), 
		         nanoscience and colloidal chemistry, stochastic thermodynamics, and machine learning.
		         Some of the ongoing projects in our group are:
		        	</p>
		        <p>
<li>Dynamics of nanoparticles in interaction with heterogeneous surfaces</li>
<li>Phase behavior and dynamics of biological macromolecules in liquid environment</li>
<li>Machine learning for finding the hidden physical rules in nanoscale systems</li>
